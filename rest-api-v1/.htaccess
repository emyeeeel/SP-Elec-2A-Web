# RewriteEngine On
# Purpose : Enables the Apache mod_rewrite engine, which allows URL rewriting.
# What it does : Without this line, the subsequent rewrite rules would be ignored.
RewriteEngine On

# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
# Purpose : Checks if the requested URL does not map to an existing file.
# Breakdown :
#   %{REQUEST_FILENAME}: The full path to the file requested by the user.
#       !-f: The ! negates the condition, so this line means:
#       
#       "If the requested filename is NOT a valid file on the server..."
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# Purpose : Checks if the requested URL does not map to an existing directory.
#Breakdown :
#   !-d:
#
#   "If the requested filename is NOT a valid directory on the server..."
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
# Purpose : Rewrites the URL to index.php if the previous conditions are met.
# Breakdown :
#   ^(.*)$:
#   A regular expression that matches any URL path (e.g., /books/123).
#
#   ^ = start of the string.
#
#   (.*) = capture all characters (the entire URL path).
##
#   $ = end of the string.
#
#   index.php:
#   The target script that will handle all rewritten requests.
#
#   Flags :
#   [QSA]: Query String Append
#   Preserves existing query parameters (e.g., ?id=1 in /books?id=1).
# 
#   [L]: Last Rule
#   Stops processing further rewrite rules if this one matches.
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
